    <h2>What is Css?</h2>
    <ol style="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="one">Css is not neccesary</span><span class="two"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can controal the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><span class="three">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using  a style elementl in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However.<span class="test">In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
        <p>When compating CSS class vs ID, the difference in that CSS class applies   a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. </p>
        <p>I here is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
